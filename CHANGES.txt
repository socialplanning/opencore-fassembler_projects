Added support for Twirlip in the frontend project.

If Twirlip is used (which is the default), the frontend will host
Twirlip at the path /notifications and will also filter the entire
application with Transcluder, since the UI for Twirlip is transcluded
into pages.

To disable Twirlip support, build the frontend project with the
setting ``use_twirlip=0``.

Also included in this release is an experimental zine project;
this is incomplete and should not be used in production builds.
