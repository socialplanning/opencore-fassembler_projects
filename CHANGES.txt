The frontend project now looks for the ``num_extra_zopes`` setting in
build.ini [general] section. 

This setting is now used to determine the default value of
``opencore_remote_uri`` if that parameter is not set.

If ``num_extra_zopes`` is set, the default value of
``opencore_remote_uri`` will now be a space-separated list of URLs for
all the Zope instances built (assumed to be on their default ports,
e.g. 10001, 10011, 10021 etc)

Added support for Twirlip in the frontend project.

If Twirlip is used (which is the default), the frontend will host
Twirlip at the path /notifications and will also filter the entire
application with Transcluder, since the UI for Twirlip is transcluded
into pages.

To disable Twirlip support, build the frontend project with the
setting ``use_twirlip=0``.

Also included in this release is an experimental zine project;
this is incomplete and should not be used in production builds.
